### 3D-printing Enclosure

Two different enclosures are provided.

#### Variant_01 (made by @cyb3rn0id)
- Description: there are 2 sets of 4 feets: one is for the XH-M401 module (switching regulator based on the XL4016E) and another for a 50x70 protoboard. You must insert M3 6mm brass inserts in the feets.
There are 2 slots too: one for the relay module and another for the current sensor ACS712 breakbout board. Arduino Nano and the LM2596S step-down regulator will be mounted on the protoboard. 
Display will be attached on the front panel by screwing 4 short M3 screws without using inserts, directly in the plastic feet.
Front panel contains toggle switch, pushbutton, display, output sockets, potentiometer
Back panel contains input socket, fuse holder
- Dimensions: 140x170x60 (Width x Depth x Height)
