WORK IN PROGRESS

### Enclosure
We've designed 2 different enclosures. They're both based on the [Ultimate Box Maker](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1264391) by HeartMan on Thingiverse.
You can download and customize the original project from Thingiverse if you want to make your own enclosure.
See [/cad/stl folder](/cad/stl) for further informations on provided STLs to be 3Dprinted.
